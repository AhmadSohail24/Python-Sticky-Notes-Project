# Python-Sticky-Notes-Project

We are going to create a Note Writing Area using Python. This Note will have a function to write, edit, update and delete the note. Using this application, you can create a number of notes and save them. You can also redo a note and see through it whenever you want. This application helps users to do more than one note at a single time too.

Let us have a look at the prerequisites for this project.

Project Prerequisites
This is an intermediate level project. We will install the Tkinter Module to create an easy GUI in python and Sqlite3 Module for creating the database. Use the following commands to install these.

Pip install tk
You do not need to install Sqlite3 as it is already a part of the python packages.
